## New Issues

When [opening a new issue](https://github.com/finos/fdc3/issues/new), please add relevant labels (e.g. *context-data*, *api*, *1.2*, etc).  This will help ensure the relevant stakeholders respond in timely fashion. 


## Pull Requests

### Types of Pull Requests

Pull requests to FDC3 generally fall into 2 categories:
- Changes to the standard
- Improvements to the documentation

The process for changing the standard usually involves work outside of Github - i.e. discussion within working groups to build concensus around the proposal, though a PR can often be a very effective way to start a proposal, and it is strongly encouraged. 

### Your First Pull Request

We have a label for [beginner friendly issues](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/labels/good%20first%20issue) for issues that don't require much domain knowledge of FDC3. This is a great place to get started.

### Sending a Pull Request

Small pull requests are much easier to review and more likely to get merged. Make sure the PR does only one thing, otherwise please split it.

Please make sure the following is done when submitting a pull request:

1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/finos/FDC3) and create your branch from `master`.
1. Add the copyright notice to the top of any code new files you've added.
1. Describe your [**test plan**](#test-plan) in your pull request description. Make sure to [test your changes](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/master/admin/testing-changes-on-Docusaurus-itself.md)!
1. Make sure your code lints (`yarn prettier && yarn lint`).
1. Make sure your Jest tests pass (`yarn test`).
1. If you haven't already, [sign the CLA](https://code.facebook.com/cla).

All pull requests should be opened against the `master` branch.
